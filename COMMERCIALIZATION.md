## When to Go Private:
1. When adding proprietary features
2. Before adding payment processing
3. When developing unique algorithms
4. If partnering with health companies

## Technical Considerations:
- Current architecture supports easy transition
- Can add auth/payments without major refactor
- Consider HIPAA compliance for US market
- May need to implement end-to-end encryption

## Keep Public:

- General AI integration
- Core PWA functionality

## Make Private/Proprietary:
- Custom AI prompts for specific conditions
- Advanced analytics algorithms  
- Integration with health devices
- Unique UI/UX improvements

## Next Steps:
1. Validate with 10-20 beta users
2. Identify most requested features
3. Research health app regulations
4. Decide on business model
