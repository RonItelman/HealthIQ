I have multiple chronic health conditions that seem interconnected:

  PRIMARY CONDITIONS:
  1. Chronic Fatigue - Persistent exhaustion that doesn't improve with rest, affects daily activities
  2. Eczema - Skin inflammation and irritation, severity varies
  3. Sinus Issues - Chronic congestion, post-nasal drip, sinus pressure
  4. Breathing Difficulties - Shortness of breath, chest tightness, especially during physical activity

  OBSERVATIONS:
  - Symptoms improved significantly on strict elimination diet (only chicken, rice, vegetables)
  - Symptoms return when reintroducing other foods
  - Fatigue levels fluctuate throughout the day
  - All symptoms seem to worsen together, suggesting systemic inflammation

  SUSPECTED TRIGGERS:
  - Food sensitivities (possibly gluten, dairy, processed foods)
  - Environmental factors
  - Stress and sleep quality
  - Physical exertion levels

  GOALS:
  - Identify specific food triggers through detailed tracking
  - Find patterns between diet, activities, and symptom severity
  - Optimize daily routines to minimize fatigue
  - Understand the connection between respiratory symptoms and other conditions

  CURRENT DIET APPROACH:
  I need to track specific foods and their timing relative to symptom onset, I am unsure yet what diet to follow, I was told by a nutritionist to target 2,000 calories a day. 

  ABOUT ME:
  - 6'3"
  - 230 pounds
  - Medications are Asmanex and Nuvigil (about 200-250MG/day)

  Please analyze my daily logs for:
  - Correlations between specific foods and symptom flares
  - Energy patterns throughout the day
  - Impact of exercise/activity on breathing and fatigue
  - Skin condition changes related to diet or environment
  - Overall inflammation indicators
