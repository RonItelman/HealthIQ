## Quick Start (Mobile-Friendly)

### Option 1: Use via Vercel (Recommended) üöÄ

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (one-click):
   - Click here: [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/RonItelman/HealthIQ)
   - Add your Anthropic API key as environment variable: `CLAUDE_API_KEY`
   - Deploy!

2. **Access on your phone**:
   - Visit your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
   - Add to home screen for app-like experience

### Option 2: Local Development

1. Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RonItelman/HealthIQ.git
cd HealthIQ
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:8000
```

**Note**: The local development server runs on port 8000 to avoid conflicts with other services. It includes:
- Auto-reload on file changes
- Mock Claude API responses for testing
- Proper MIME types for all assets
- Service worker support

3. For production-like local testing with Vercel:
```bash
# Set up your API key in .env.local
echo "CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env.local

# Run with Vercel CLI
npm run dev:vercel
```

## Mobile Setup Guide

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Fork this repository
2. Sign up for [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (free)
3. Import your forked repository
4. Add environment variable: `CLAUDE_API_KEY` = your API key
5. Deploy and access from any device!

### For Gist Method:
1. No server needed - runs entirely in browser
2. First time: app will prompt for your Vercel API URL
3. Your API endpoint is saved locally on device
4. Works offline (except AI features)

## Security & Privacy

### Your Data is Safe:
- ‚úÖ **Health data stays on YOUR device** (localStorage)
- ‚úÖ **API key stored in Vercel** (not in code)
- ‚úÖ **Each deployment is isolated** to your account
- ‚úÖ **No data is sent anywhere** except to Claude for analysis

### Security Best Practices:
1. **Keep your Vercel app URL private** if you want exclusive access
2. **Add domain restrictions** (optional):
   - Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Vercel environment variables
   - Example: `https://your-gist-url.github.io,http://localhost:3000`
3. **Your health entries are never uploaded** - they stay in your browser
4. **The public repository contains no personal data**

### What Others Can See:
- ‚ùå Your API key (hidden in Vercel)
- ‚ùå Your health data (stored locally)  
- ‚úÖ The app code (open source)
- ‚úÖ Your Vercel app URL (if you share it)
